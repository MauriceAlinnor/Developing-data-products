## Introduction

- This presentation seeks to show the relationship between miles per gallon (mpg) and weight (wt) using the mtcars data set in R.

- The project would feature an interactive plot created using plotly and host the resulting web page on RPubs.

```{r prerequisites, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(datasets)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(data.table)
```

## cars data set 
```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=""}

head(mtcars)
summary(cars)
```

## Plot showing relationship between miles per gallon (mpg) and weight (wt) 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~mpg, y = ~wt, mode = "markers")%>%
        add_trace(x = ~mpg, y = ~wt, type="scatter", mode = "markers", 
            name = "slight", legendgroup = "slight", 
            marker = list(color = "#52A9BD")) 
```
